## Project Vision & Purpose

1. **In your own words, what is the primary purpose of this trading bot project?**  
   This project is both a personal hobby and a shared experience. I see it as a chance to enjoy quality time with friends while building something challenging and rewarding. At the same time, I believe it has the potential to become a serious and valuable opportunity if we make the bot effective.

2. **What specific problem(s) are we trying to solve with this bot?**  
   Trying to understand how to create and automate trading strategies that can work in real-world conditions, with the long-term potential of generating income or insight from algorithmic trading.

3. **Who is the intended end user for this project?**  
   Primarily us. But if successful, why not making this bigger.

4. **What would make this project a success in your view?**  
   A functional trading bot capable of running multiple strategies, learning from performance, and generating consistent returns even if small. Success also includes for me learning deeply about trading, AWS, and AI.

5. **What aspects of this project are you personally most excited about?** 
   I'm excited about everything: the technical challenges, the trading logic, the deployment pipeline, and working as a team. But especially the learning journey. Gaining trading knowledge, improving my DevOps skills, and discovering new AI applications.

## Technical Understanding & Responsibilities

1. **Which parts of the project's technology stack are you most comfortable with?**  
   I'm most comfortable with both backend and frontend development, especially using JavaScript/Node.js and all the frameworks around. I also have solid experience with infrastructure tools like AWS, Terraform, Ansible, and system configuration (Linux, NGINX, iptables).

2. **Which parts would you like to learn more about or need help with?**  
   I want to deepen my understanding of trading algorithms, market data analysis, and AI-assisted decision-making in the financial domain.

3. **What specific components or features would you like to take ownership of?**  
   I would be happy to take responsibility for system integration, DevOps pipelines, Terraform-based deployment, and possibly the trading bot execution logic. But I would feel more comfortable leading or co-building the backend system and later a dashboard if needed.

4. **Do you have experience with cryptocurrency trading or related financial systems?**  
   Not really (just personnal investment), but I’m eager to learn and contribute from a software and system perspective.

5. **Are there any technical risks or challenges you foresee that we should address early?**  
   Keeping cloud costs under control, preventing bugs in live trading, and maintaining security for API keys and trade logic are key. We’ll also need to manage technical complexity as we scale strategies.

## Project Management & Collaboration

1. **What's your preferred working style (independent vs collaborative, structured vs flexible)?**  
   I like collaborative work that’s loosely structured, enough to stay aligned without being too rigid. I’m adaptable to different styles depending on the task and phase.

2. **How do you prefer to communicate about project updates or blockers?**  
   Mostly WhatsApp, with occasional calls or async updates. I’m flexible as long as it’s efficient and respectful of everyone’s time.

3. **How often do you think we should sync as a team?**  
   Weekly or bi-weekly syncs sound good, with ad-hoc updates between if needed.

4. **What are your general availability hours?**  
   My availability can vary, but I’ll be there for planned sessions and check in during the week when possible.

5. **What should teammates do if they need your input but you're not immediately available?**  
   Drop me a message on WhatsApp. I’ll respond as soon as I can. If it’s urgent, feel free to ping me again.

## Timeline & Commitment

1. **How much time per week can you realistically commit to this project?**  
   Around 5–8 hours on average, more during sprints or when I’m really into a task.

2. **Are there any periods in the next 3 months when you expect to be unavailable?**  
   Not at the moment, but I’ll keep the team informed if anything changes.

3. **What do you consider a reasonable timeframe for completing a minimum viable product?**  
   A few focused weekend hackathons or around 6-8 weeks of steady effort.

4. **Would you prefer more frequent smaller milestones or fewer larger milestones?**  
   I lean toward smaller milestones — they help keep momentum and reduce risk.

5. **If the project timeline needs to be extended, what would be your constraints?**  
   I’m flexible as long as we maintain clarity and momentum. I’d rather finish something right than rush.

## Technical Strategy & Decisions

1. **Should we prioritize extending trading strategy, or focus first on improving the infrastructure?**  
   I’d prioritize getting a working trading strategy going early, then invest more into infrastructure as we scale.

2. **What's your opinion on adding a frontend dashboard now versus later?**  
   Later is fine. Let’s prove out the backend and trading logic first, then make a dashboard to visualize it when it adds value.

3. **Should we integrate with exchanges beyond Binance? If so, which ones and why?**  
   For now, Binance Testnet is a good scope. Let’s master one before adding more.

4. **Do you think we should implement real trading capabilities, or remain in sandbox/testnet mode until certain criteria are met?**  
   We should stick to paper trading first. Once we’ve validated strategy performance and built some safeguards, we can explore real trading.

5. **What security considerations do you think are most important for this project?**  
   Protecting API keys, setting trade limits, and controlling cost and access in AWS are key security concerns.

## Expectations & Success Metrics

1. **How would you define "done" for the first release of this project?**  
   A bot running on AWS that can execute a couple of strategies on historical and/or live data with tracked results in DynamoDB.

2. **What metrics should we use to evaluate the bot's performance?**  
   Profit/loss over time, return per trade, and time-to-profit. Also reliability and frequency of successful executions.

3. **What would you consider a realistic target for the bot's profitability?**  
   Even 1–2% per month would be a great success to start.

4. **What non-financial benefits do you hope to gain from this project?**  
   Technical growth, trading knowledge, and meaningful collaboration with a great team.

5. **What would need to happen for you to consider this project a complete success?**  
   A working multi-strategy bot with clear, measurable performance and a feeling of shared achievement with the team.
