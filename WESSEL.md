## Project Vision & Purpose

1. In your own words, what is the primary purpose of this trading bot project?

To learn how to implement multiple automated trading strategies.

2. What specific problem(s) are we trying to solve with this bot?

How to paper trade on historical data and real time trading through API's on the crypto market. 

3. Who is the intended end user for this project?

Me and the bois. 

4. What would make this project a success in your view?

To have 1-3 trading strategies running simulatiously to gauge relative performance. And to go through at least 2 
sessions of improving the algorithm(s), essentially having multiple generations of the bots.

5. What aspects of this project are you personally most excited about?

Testing different strategies against one another and to iterate on them. The potential to make money and use AWS lambda functions.

## Technical Understanding & Responsibilities

1. Which parts of the project's technology stack are you most comfortable with?

Historical data for paper trading. 

2. Which parts would you like to learn more about or need help with?

I want to learn how to have AWS run multiple lambda functions concurently and make sure it works well concurently with the API calls. 

3. What specific components or features would you like to take ownership of?

Being responsible for at least 1 implementation of a trading algo and sourcing of data. 

4. Do you have experience with cryptocurrency trading or related financial systems?

No experience with crypto trading but relatively large experience with stock markets. 

5. Are there any technical risks or challenges you foresee that we should address early?

How to avoid the illusion of a competent trading algorithm by making sure to train the algorithm on many different sections of the historical
data and not just believe the algorithm performs well because it performs well over the whole time frame.

## Project Management & Collaboration

1. What's your preferred working style (independent vs collaborative, structured vs flexible)?

Colaborative and structured around predetermined times (i.e the weekend hackathons) with time for independent work if willing between the 
weekend hackathons. 

2. How do you prefer to communicate about project updates or blockers?

In person if important or just over whatsapp. 

3. How often do you think we should sync as a team?

every 2 weeks. 

4. What are your general availability hours?

weekends mostly and a bit during the week. But there is the possibility that I have to go visit home/girlfriend every now and then. This is
usually centered around a weekend.

5. What should teammates do if they need your input but you're not immediately available?

Always call, if I don't pick up try again in an hour or leave me a txt message. 

## Timeline & Commitment

1. How much time per week can you realistically commit to this project?

5 - 8 hours a week. Willing and able to do more during sprints (i.e weekend hackathons). 

2. Are there any periods in the next 3 months when you expect to be unavailable?

July in general I will be very busy and won't have much time. 28 - 30 may.  

3. What do you consider a reasonable timeframe for completing a minimum viable product?

2 weekend hackathons. 

4. Would you prefer more frequent smaller milestones or fewer larger milestones?

fewer larger milestones

5. If the project timeline needs to be extended, what would be your constraints?

Can't work in July realistically or very little. After that I can contribute again. 

## Technical Strategy & Decisions

1. Should we prioritize extending trading strategy, or focus first on improving the infrastructure?

Trading strategy, it's the main motivating factor. Once we feel we sufficient experience and multiple trading 
strategies I would then make an effort to improve the infrastructure. 

2. What's your opinion on adding a frontend dashboard now versus later?

I would do it later, you can see performance on the console initially. Once you have more than 2 trading bots, 
I would build the dashboard. 

3. Should we integrate with exchanges beyond Binance? If so, which ones and why?

No, stick to 1 at first, Binance is good. 

4. Do you think we should implement real trading capabilities, or remain in sandbox/testnet mode until certain criteria are met?

implement the real trading capabilities. But still just paper trade with the info from the API's until confident. 

5. What security considerations do you think are most important for this project?

Over spending money if the algorithm isn't limited. 

## Expectations & Success Metrics

1. How would you define "done" for the first release of this project?

2 Algorithms that can trade on historical and current data. 

2. What metrics should we use to evaluate the bot's performance?

Pure profit and time to earn a dollar. 

3. What would you consider a realistic target for the bot's profitability?

1-2 % per month. 

4. What non-financial benefits do you hope to gain from this project?

Experience with different trading algorithms and the exchange API. Plus fun time with friends. 

5. What would need to happen for you to consider this project a complete success?

Multiple bots trading with at least 1 clear winning strategy trading with some real money.
