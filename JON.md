## Project Vision & Purpose

1.‚Å† ‚Å†In your own words, what is the primary purpose of this trading bot project?

  I'm interested in seeing what's the return-per-effort of investing, given our IT knowledge. 
  If it's significantly higher than a job, then we could do that for an income and use our time for more fulfilling things

2.‚Å† ‚Å†What specific problem(s) are we trying to solve with this bot?

  To not have to work for money

3.‚Å† ‚Å†Who is the intended end user for this project?

  Us, mainly. Selling or renting the service could also be a possibility

4.‚Å† ‚Å†What would make this project a success in your view?

  I'll consider it a success if we can either:
   - confirm that trading isn't worth it, or
   - create a trading bot that generates a decent ROI
 
5.‚Å† ‚Å†What aspects of this project are you personally most excited about?

  The trading bot system (API calls), and the ability to implement and test our own algorithms

## Technical Understanding & Responsibilities

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Which parts of the project's technology stack are you most comfortable with?

  API and network calls, and algorithm implementations

2.‚Å† ‚Å†Which parts would you like to learn more about or need help with?

  Databases. Specifically Database to business logic connections (I konw SQL and JS pretty good, but havent used both together)

3.‚Å† ‚Å†What specific components or features would you like to take ownership of?

  APIs and algorithms code (I'm good at turning maths to code)

4.‚Å† ‚Å†Do you have experience with cryptocurrency trading or related financial systems?

  Yes, but it was a bad experience :)

5.‚Å† ‚Å†Are there any technical risks or challenges you foresee that we should address early?

  Nope

## Project Management & Collaboration

1.‚Å† ‚Å†What's your preferred working style (independent vs collaborative, structured vs flexible)?

  Collaborative, and with lots of communication. Pair programming for the win!!üöÄ

2.‚Å† ‚Å†How do you prefer to communicate about project updates or blockers?

  Anything, as long as it has notifications and is easy to maintain and read.

3.‚Å† ‚Å†How often do you think we should sync as a team?

  As often as we work. If we only work on this on weekends, we can hangout every saturday/sunday 

4.‚Å† ‚Å†What are your general availability hours?

  Couple hours every day

5.‚Å† ‚Å†What should teammates do if they need your input but you're not immediately available?

  Wait :)

## Timeline & Commitment

1.‚Å† ‚Å†How much time per week can you realistically commit to this project?

  8 - 14

2.‚Å† ‚Å†Are there any periods in the next 3 months when you expect to be unavailable?

  I've got exams from 36 May to 6 June

3.‚Å† ‚Å†What do you consider a reasonable timeframe for completing a minimum viable product?

  A couple weeks for paper trading, a month for a working demo

4.‚Å† ‚Å†Would you prefer more frequent smaller milestones or fewer larger milestones?

  Frequent small

5.‚Å† ‚Å†If the project timeline needs to be extended, what would be your constraints?

  No constraints. It's done when it's done

## Technical Strategy & Decisions

1.‚Å† ‚Å†Should we prioritize extending trading strategy, or focus first on improving the infrastructure?

  Both are important, but strategies will have a shorter implementation time than the trading system, 
  so we should limit the trading system's scope more than the strategy implementations

2.‚Å† ‚Å†What's your opinion on adding a frontend dashboard now versus later?

  We should probably create a very simple dashboard first so we can do the backtesting and monitoring, and slowly improve it

3.‚Å† ‚Å†Should we integrate with exchanges beyond Binance? If so, which ones and why?

  I'd limit the scope to one coin, one info source, one broker and multiple strategies. Then we can expand to other coins/info/brokers

4.‚Å† ‚Å†Do you think we should implement real trading capabilities, or remain in sandbox/testnet mode until certain criteria are met?

  Sandbox for a while, but if implementing the API calls is not too hard we can do it sooner

5.‚Å† ‚Å†What security considerations do you think are most important for this project?

  API keys, certificates and passwords should be handled with care

## Expectations & Success Metrics

1.‚Å† ‚Å†How would you define "done" for the first release of this project?

  We can backtest any given algorithm

2.‚Å† ‚Å†What metrics should we use to evaluate the bot's performance?

  Both average P/L and amount of profit days vs loss days

3.‚Å† ‚Å†What would you consider a realistic target for the bot's profitability?

  I'm here for the data. If it sucks, that's ok, at least then we will know

4.‚Å† ‚Å†What non-financial benefits do you hope to gain from this project?

  Less hair loss

5.‚Å† ‚Å†What would need to happen for you to consider this project a complete success?

  Clear and concrete proof that we should or shouldn't do this as a job
